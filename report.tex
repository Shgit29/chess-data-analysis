% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This comprehensive data analysis report examines chess game performance through systematic evaluation of move quality, error patterns, and strategic decision-making across different game phases. Using the Stockfish 15 chess engine as the analytical foundation, we processed and analyzed chess games in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format to identify inaccuracies, mistakes, and blunders. The study encompasses opening preparation analysis, middle-game tactical evaluation, and endgame technique assessment. Our methodology combines traditional chess analysis with modern data science techniques, providing actionable insights for performance improvement. The complete analytical framework and source code are available in the project GitHub repository, ensuring reproducibility and transparency of results.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview}
Chess, as one of the most studied strategic games, provides a rich dataset for performance analysis. This project develops a comprehensive data analysis framework to evaluate chess playing strength through systematic move evaluation and error categorization. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in decision-making quality across different phases of the game and provides statistical insights into performance optimization.

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objectives of this analysis include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an automated system for chess move quality evaluation
    \item Categorize and quantify different types of playing errors
    \item Analyze performance patterns across game phases (opening, middle-game, endgame)
    \item Investigate correlation between error types and game outcomes
    \item Create actionable insights for strategic improvement
    \item Establish a reproducible analytical framework for chess performance evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do error frequencies vary across different phases of chess games?
    \item What is the correlation between specific error types and game outcomes?
    \item How does opening choice influence subsequent middle-game performance?
    \item What patterns emerge when analyzing performance by playing color (White vs. Black)?
    \item Can we identify specific areas for targeted improvement based on error analysis?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation}

\subsection{Chess Engine Evaluation}
Modern chess engines, particularly Stockfish, utilize sophisticated evaluation functions combining material balance, positional factors, and deep tactical calculation. The engine's evaluation in centipawns (hundredths of a pawn) provides a quantitative measure of position quality, enabling systematic analysis of move quality \cite{stockfish2023}.

\subsection{Error Classification Framework}
Chess errors are traditionally classified into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inaccuracies} (50-100 centipawn loss): Suboptimal moves that slightly worsen the position
    \item \textbf{Mistakes} (100-300 centipawn loss): Significant errors that provide substantial advantage to the opponent
    \item \textbf{Blunders} (300+ centipawn loss): Serious tactical oversights that often decide the game outcome
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Phase Analysis}
Chess games are typically analyzed in three distinct phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Opening} (moves 1-15): Piece development, king safety, center control
    \item \textbf{Middle-game} (moves 16-40): Tactical combinations, strategic planning
    \item \textbf{Endgame} (moves 41+): Technical precision, theoretical knowledge
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection}
The analysis utilizes chess games stored in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format, separated into two datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{MAF13-white.pgn}: Games played as White
    \item \texttt{MAF13-black.pgn}: Games played as Black
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Architecture}
The analytical framework consists of four primary components:

\subsubsection{Move Evaluation Engine (\texttt{Clean.py})}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Core Engine Configuration}]
STOCKFISH_PATH = Path("/usr/bin/stockfish")
DEPTH_BEST = 10      # Best move calculation depth
DEPTH_PLAYED = 8     # Played move evaluation depth

engine = chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(
    str(STOCKFISH_PATH), timeout=20
)
engine.configure({
    "Threads": 4,
    "Hash": 512
})
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Statistical Processing (\texttt{Calculation.py})}
Processes raw evaluation data to generate filtered datasets focusing on error-containing games and player-specific analysis.

\subsubsection{Performance Analytics (\texttt{Analytics.py})}
Generates win-rate statistics, phase-based performance metrics, and correlation analysis between error types and outcomes.

\subsubsection{Opening Analysis (\texttt{Openings.py})}
Analyzes opening performance by color, providing insights into preparation quality and subsequent game development.

\subsection{Data Processing Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Game Parsing and Move Evaluation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parse PGN files to extract individual games
    \item For each move, calculate best move evaluation at depth 10
    \item Evaluate played move quality at depth 8
    \item Calculate centipawn loss for each move
    \item Classify errors based on centipawn thresholds
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Error Categorization}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Error Classification Logic}]
def classify_error(centipawn_loss):
    if centipawn_loss >= 300:
        return "blunder"
    elif centipawn_loss >= 100:
        return "mistake"  
    elif centipawn_loss >= 50:
        return "inaccuracy"
    else:
        return "accurate"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Phase Determination}
Games are segmented into phases based on move number and game characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Opening: Moves 1-15
    \item Middle-game: Moves 16-40 
    \item Endgame: Moves 41+
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Statistical Aggregation}
Generate comprehensive statistics including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Error frequency by phase and type
    \item Win rates correlated with error patterns
    \item Opening performance by color
    \item Move-by-move accuracy progression
\end{itemize}
